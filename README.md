## Abstract

The main goal of this thesis is to develop a web application to help motivate and support users to stay consistent throughout their fitness journey and adopt a healthy lifestyle, despite various challenges they may face. These challenges include the high cost of gym equipment and clothing, limited social interaction within the gyms, and difficulty finding suitable workout partners and buddies. To address these issues, we implemented a system that simplifies purchasing second-hand equipment and clothing, so users can find quality items within their budget. The system also includes a social component that provides easy communication and connection among users, enabling them to find their ideal workout partners, make friends, and establish a supportive community within their fitness journey. The system is implemented as a web application using the .NET Web API framework as a server-side technology, Angular as a client-side framework, and PostgreSQL as a database provider. Real-time messaging functionalities are implemented using SignalR, ensuring instant communication. The system integrates Stripe as a payment service, which allows users to have a trusted and reliable platform that takes care of the security of their financial transactions. Additionally, Redis serves as a cache database for efficient storage and retrieval of frequently accessed data, including usersâ€™ baskets and basket items.
